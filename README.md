<h1>Stock Hunter</h1>
<br/>
<p>Stock Hunter is a financial web application that aims to provide useful stock information such as price chart, option chain, quotes, news and etc. in a way that lets users focus on what's most important. Its simple nonobstructive design filters out the noise and shows only what really matters. Because at the end it is all about numbers. Users can save stocks they follow into custom watchlists.</p>
<br/>
<p>The project is built with Meteor framework. Stocks data is pulled from Tradier API. The database runs on MongoDB. For charts, I chose Highcharts.js library.</p>
